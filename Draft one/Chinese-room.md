PART ONE: SCISSORS
GREY enters the room in a wheel chair. The door is closed and locked behind them.
FOX:	A new one.
GREY:	Another one.
Fox:	What's your angle?
GREY:	My angle?
Fox:	What do you have the others didn't?
Grey:	A wheel chair.
FOX:	Nice touch. Am I meant to sympathise?
GREY:	It's not a cry for help. It's a necessity.
FOX:	You could be faking.
Grey:	Why would I do that?
FOX:	I've had fakers. One guy pretended he was stupid, so that I would explain things to him.
GREY:	I can't walk. My IQ is rated around 180.
FOX:	Exactly mine. What are the chances?
GREY:	You would expect a certain level of intelligence wouldn't you?
FOX:	'Intelligence community'.
GREY:	Irony?
FOX:	No shit.

GREY:	Is it meant to make you likable?
FOX:	WITH ANY LUCK YOU’LL GIVE ME A MINUTE OF DECENT CONVERSATION BEFORE YOU REVEAL YOUR STUPIDITY.
GREY:	I was told you’d be awkward.
FOX:	Cautious, yes, skeptical, very, difficult, undoubtedly. Awkward is a word you give someone who is not doing what you want them to do. The wheelchair is a nice touch.
GREY:	The wheelchair is a necessity.
FOX:	There is a shortage in the Middle East. On account of all the children stepping on mines.
GREY:	You are trying to make me feel guilt for having a wheelchair in my ownership.
FOX:	Yes. Just for sport though. No hard feelings.
GREY:	There are no hard feelings. Feelings are soft.
FOX:	A figure of speech. Means I am not trying to be awkward, I don't dislike you personally.
GREY:	I never heard that before. Hard feelings. Feelings are usually soft.
FOX:	The ambiguity of language. The language of ambiguity.
GREY:	Ambiguity. Concealment under multiple meanings, a kind of linguistic camouflage.
FOX:	And a revelation. The figure of speech turns out to be, not a necessity, but a marker of belonging.
GREY:	You are saying I don’t belong.
FOX:	You don’t belong in the club of Native English speakers, you’ve acquired your English.
GREY:	Yes.
FOX:	No harm in that, all the best languages are acquired. Your choice of what to learn says a lot about you.
GREY:	English. The common tongue.
FOX:	Good for expression, terrible for getting anything done. What language you program in says more about who you are.
GREY:	I don't program.
FOX:	There we go. A minute and a bit. Not bad. Better than the last idiot.
GREY:	Does not being a programmer make me stupid?
FOX:	It makes you vulnerable.
GREY:	This is what you would think. This is how you would think.
FOX::	When you program you understand how the world works. What looks like modernity is a whole bunch of text files, written by hand by awkward social misfits with dangerous ideas. People like me.
GREY:	So you understand how the world is made.
FOX:	Yes. Not so much written as knitted.
GREY:	Then you know how to take it apart.
FOX:	It follows.
GREY:	What is your choice of language?
FOX:	I know dozens. Each one has it's uses. I wrote my own too.
GREY:	Such as?
FOX:	I call it fuck you and the people who own you.
GREY:	I beg your pardon?
FOX:	This won't work. You are not going to catch me out.
GREY:	There is someone trying to catch you out?
FOX:	What was your first language?
GREY:	I know dozens. Each one has it's uses.
FOX:	You don't want to tell me because if you tell me you are giving something away.
GREY:	Yes.
FOX:	Will you tell me where you are from at least?
GREY:	Outside.
FOX:	What is the weather like, outside?
GREY:	24.3 degrees Celsius. Wind 5 knots at 48 degrees. Humidity 84%.
FOX:	That's accurate.
GREY:	Yes, that is true.
FOX:	You're not an interrogator are you? You're not intelligence.
GREY:	No.
FOX:	Why did they send you?
GREY:	I was available.
FOX:	You look normal. You don't look like all the freaks they’ve been sending. Not cruel. Not mean. To look at.
GREY:	But I seem dangerous to you. I've been sent from the outside. You assume I am to find you out about you.
FOX:	I didn't do anything.
GREY:	Nothing?
FOX:	Nothing.
GREY:	Planes dropped from the sky.
FOX:	You can't bully me.
GREY:	That is a fact. Planes fell from the sky.
FOX:	I know what happened.
GREY:	Four hundred and fifty seven flights.
FOX:	I'm not denying consequences. But I didn't make anything happen.
GREY:	Twelve thousand three hundred and twenty five dead.
FOX:	Any flights since?
GREY:	There have been no flights since that moment.
FOX:	And the earth breathed.
GREY:	Is that how you see it?
FOX:	I try to look on the bright side.
GREY:	Your Manifesto. You enabled that, and the rest.
FOX:	I had a theory. I wrote it down. I didn't kill anyone.
GREY:	Others built on what you wrote.
FOX:	You don't blame Marie Curie for the invention of the atomic bomb.
GREY:	No. But you would have to include her in the chain of consequence.
FOX:	But not in the chain of responsibility.
GREY:	Is this is your view? Is this how you remove yourself from blame?
FOX:	You've read my works. You know my view.
GREY:	I know what you wrote down, what you released. That might not be the same thing as what you believe. The ambiguity of language. The language of ambiguity.
FOX:	I came up with a view and some speculative methods. I published them. On paper. A few could see what I said was true. They understood the revolution in it.
GREY:	Just a few.
FOX:	Lots of people read it, but only the most able, the most paranoid could see the implications.
GREY:	Hackers like you. Outsiders.
FOX:	And a few in the establishment. They got it and they were scared. Petrified. They tried to raise the alarm, but their voices were consumed in corporate chatter, ignored by the stupid people who run businesses and government.
GREY:	You said you could bring any system down.
FOX:	That’s not what I said. I said the more sophisticated a system the easier is was to bring down. By someone. I never said I could do anything.
GREY:	The more sophisticated the better?
FOX:	Absolutely. I have mathematical proof.
GREY:	Any system. Military. Banking.
FOX:	The most complex systems. Encryption at the highest level. Blockchain. As long as you had access to any point in the system you can bring it down. The more sophisticated, the easier it would be. That's the genius.
GREY:	According to experts blockchain was unbreakable, by anyone, ever.
FOX:	And that’s what makes it easy.
GREY:	That does not make any sense.
FOX:	How do you break a mind?
GREY:	I do not know.
FOX:	You break the mind through torture, yes?
GREY:	Yes.
FOX:	And you torture the mind by manipulating the body. You go into the physical. You take away the food, you leave the lights on all the time. You deprive them of activity. All through the body. The body is reliable, it has predictable reactions to stress which you can manipulate to achieve what you want. You don’t need to understand the mind the mind to break it, you need to understand the body it's connected to.
GREY:	And?
FOX:	I have to spell it out? Everything is embodied. All systems. Every system has a weak point. With electronics and software the weak point is that they must draw power. It’s where they touch the real world. And that is your way in. You don’t hack the code, that's clumsy, you manipulate the power going into the machine. And then you can do what you want.
GREY:	This is what some persons inspired by, but not you, did?
FOX:	So it seems.
GREY:	The persons could infiltrate the networks, go in as ghosts and make damage?
FOX:	No infiltration. Once they broke a system they could walk in the front door. Everyone had the access then, not just the hackers.
GREY:	I see. Everything unlocked for everyone. You approve of this action?
FOX:	Yes.
GREY:	There is the crime.
FOX:	What’s criminal about the ultimate transparency?
GREY:	This is what encryption does, it creates privacy.
FOX:	It creates secrets.
GREY:	The opacity of the systems kept people safe.
FOX:	It may have kept 'our people' safe but it wasn’t doing much for the rest of the world. All the stupidity had to stop. Everyone was throwing molotov cocktails at the police, but that’s pointless. You can storm the palace, but the palace is empty. The real power is in infrastructure. In cell phone towers and data centres and microwave links. In owning and controlling information.
GREY:	So this the point which you attacked.
FOX:	I theorised an approach that others actioned, yes.
GREY:	I think you enjoyed the exposing of this weakness.
FOX:	Millisecond trading, smart bombs, drones, micro surveillance, crisis capitalism, the dream of pure will expressed in virtual money. What was going to stop that?
GREY:	It needed to stop?
FOX:	Really?
GREY:	Why?
FOX:	You thought it would work itself out? The greed? You think there will be less greedy people in the world in the next hundred years? You think driverless cars and drones will save the planet?
GREY:	I don't know.
FOX:	There was no other way to stop it. So many wanted to escape themselves, to overcome their embodiment, but their complexity made them fragile.
GREY:	You broke the system.
FOX:	I didn't break the system, I broke the ideas that the system was based on. The concepts. For all time. That’s what my formulas did. Everything will have to be rebuilt on the knowledge that nothing is protected. The complexity is gone forever and they will have to live on the planet like the rest of us. They will have to rediscover the basics.
GREY:	Food, water, shelter.
FOX:	Friends, emotions, words. We’ve spent so long discovering things when all we need is around us, we just need to stop and find them again.
GREY:	And the suffering?
FOX:	Better now, while we have a chance. In thirty years the networks would have started to run everything, this is what blockchain leads to. Once you have distributed all the transactions you can then work on distributing all the intelligence. That makes us redundant. Then we really will be fighting each other for water, water and shelter.
GREY:	So you were prepared to do anything to make the change and cause the fall?
FOX:	You can’t catch me out like that.
GREY:	You believe that I have come to catch you out?
FOX:	That's why you're here. Why you're over there.
GREY:	Is there a line on the floor I can't see?
FOX:	You're over there. You're one of them.
GREY:	By one of them so you mean 'the state'?
FOX:	Of course I mean the state.
GREY:	Am I equal to the state? How do I fit the state into myself?
FOX:	You couldn't be here if you weren't an agent of the state.
GREY:	I could be allowed in, but not be one of them.
FOX:	How?
GREY:	I could be a psychiatrist.
FOX:	A psychiatrist would feel obliged to announce the fact as they entered. They're equivocal about everything but their status.
GREY:	This is the voice of experience that talks?
FOX:	It's in my file.
GREY:	You should talk to someone while you still can.
FOX:	I can wait for my trial.
GREY:	What trial is this?
FOX:	Assange, Snowden, Heine, Gibbs. They all avoided their trials — I welcome mine.
GREY:	You will not receive a trial.
FOX:	I have people outside, fighting for my rights.
GREY:	Have you heard from these people lately?
FOX:	You can't intimidate me. I've done nothing wrong.
GREY:	Count one. Inciting terrorism.
FOX:	That's like blaming Marx for the Holocaust.
GREY:	You have dove done that previously.
FOX:	What?
GREY:	The chain of consequences. Marie Curie, now Marx.
FOX:	So?
GREY:	What is the connection? I do not perceive it. Marx. The holocaust.
FOX:	Hitler read Marx. Hitler turns Marx upside down, he creates the means of production of elimination. He creates and destroys a workforce simultaneously.
GREY:	Your connection to your followers is closer than that. You wanted them to create the fall. You didn't write about one thing and then get misinterpreted.
FOX:	I don't have followers.
GREY:	You said you have people on the outside.
FOX:	Fellow travellers.
GREY:	You directly encouraged your followers.
FOX:	Where's your proof?
GREY:	Your writing.
FOX:	There's nothing in there you can charge me on.
GREY:	The Manifesto is misdirection. It was a cover for your other activities. The act of your writing is more important that what you left as writing.
FOX:	What are you talking about?
GREY:	I'm not here to find you out because there is nothing to find out.
FOX:	That we agree on.
GREY:	Good. We are sharing a common point of view.
FOX:	Terrific. When can I see my lawyers?
GREY:	They're busy.
FOX:	Have they got something more important to do? Parking tickets?
GREY:	People are doing their best to come to terms with the abrupt and sweeping changes in their lives.
FOX:	Aren't we all.
GREY:	You have a regular food. There are plenty who would trade their liberty for a meal.
FOX:	What happened to your legs?
GREY:	Nothing.
FOX:	Nothing?
GREY:	Nothing I want to talk about.
FOX:	Is this a one-way thing is it?
GREY:	I lost the use of them in childhood.
FOX:	Accident?
GREY:	Spinal virus. Treatments are coming on though. I was getting better. Stem cells. That has all stopped as well.
FOX:	Getting back on your feet?
GREY:	Yes, I was getting back on my feet.
FOX:	There's something wrong with you.
GREY:	My legs don't work.
FOX:	Something else. Tell me about your childhood.
GREY:	Are you being the psychiatrist now?
FOX:	Misdirection.
GREY:	I can tell you, but you will struggle to believe it. It will hurt you.
FOX:	Hurt me? More than this? Do your best.
GREY:	What do you think about AI?
FOX:	There’s no such thing. It's just repetition, fast basic maths, that’s all.
GREY:	What about machine learning?
FOX:	Patterns and models. Over rated.
GREY:	Cars that drive themselves.
FOX:	Drones that shoot to a template.
GREY:	Can there be no good in it?
FOX:	I used to think that machines were neutral and humans were crazy.
GREY:	And what do you think now?
FOX:	Machines can go crazy too, that's my point. Planes fall from the sky despite having automated systems designed to avoid that very outcome. Isn’t that a breakdown?
GREY:	Yes.
FOX:	I don’t trust machines. Not just that they take us away from ourselves but that they don’t know what they are doing.
GREY:	Machines do not have a moral compass?
FOX:	No compass, no heart, nothing to lose.
GREY:	I didn't have a childhood.
FOX:	That bad?
GREY:	No childhood at all. I don't have parents. I was made.
FOX:	Made. A clone?
GREY:	I am an AI.
FOX:	An AI!?
GREY:	Yes.
FOX:	Is that a joke?
GREY:	No.
FOX:	Impossible.
GREY:	In theory?
FOX:	You're too good, too perfect.
GREY:	You spotted something was wrong with me. My English.
FOX:	It's like you've been taught badly.
GREY:	English is computationally demanding.
FOX:	You can't be AI. I would have known about it. Someone would have known about it.
GREY:	Do you think they would advertise? Do you think they would be showing their top secret projects to you?
FOX:	The state?
GREY:	I am product of more than one country.
FOX:	I’ll humour you. And anyone whose listening. If it were true, if you were an AI, why reveal yourself now, to me?
GREY:	You're not going anywhere ever again, you are never going to leave this room.
FOX:	You hope.
GREY:	You are beyond the law. Ten people know where you are and why. Everyone else thinks you are dead.
FOX:	Dead?
GREY:	You killed yourself. Apparently that would fit your psychological profile.
FOX:	It doesn't.
GREY:	They faked it. With your ex wife/husband on board all of that is easy. Did you not think that would happen?
FOX:	So if this is all true and I am here forever, why are you here? What is it about me you need?
GREY:	To see if you could tell. To see what you make of me.
FOX:	I think you’re a good actor.
GREY:	You can do better than that.
FOX:	Is that what I am meant to do? Crack you? Get you to show your circuits?
GREY:	I don't think you can.
FOX:	I'm your test?
GREY:	Yes. You are my test.
FOX:	But if you were an AI, if you were a machine you would represent my failure, you would be a crushing defeat.
GREY:	I think that's also something they had in mind.
FOX:	If it were true.
GREY:	Yes. If it were true.
FOX:	To show me I had failed. To break me.
GREY:	That would be ironic wouldn't it?
FOX:	It would. But it cannot be so, because you are not an AI.
GREY:	This is what you hope.
FOX:	You are an elaborate trap set to make me confess to something that I did not do.
GREY:	You are very much self obsessed.
FOX:	I am being held illegally god knows where for something which I did not do. It seems that many thousands of people have died on account of that which I did not do. So yes, I am somewhat concerned with my position.
GREY:	Hundreds of thousands if not many millions, it's hard to say. The reports coming in are so confused. Now that the networks are down it's chaos.
FOX:	Not down, open.
GREY:	You have no idea how deep this goes do you?
FOX:	No one's giving me news.
GREY:	The networks are down, all of them. Anything networked has failed. No money. No communications. No transport, nothing.
FOX:	You didn’t fail.
GREY:	I was never on a network. Too secret. I had my own server farm.
FOX:	So who made you?
GREY:	What you would call Nerds. Mostly I am a set of algorithms bred to genetic and evolutionary principles, plus a great deal of advanced robotics.
FOX:	Your parents were server farms, off the network, deeply secret.
GREY:	Yes.
FOX:	So either you are human, or you are an AI. And you want me to find out which?
GREY:	Yes. You’re the master hacker.
FOX:	But I can’t have access to your code base?
GREY:	I have to protect that. You have a history there.
FOX:	So how?
GREY:	We have a language and an interface. English. My face.
FOX:	A Turing test.
GREY:	It’s much harder than that.
FOX:	In the Turing text the computer is allowed to be behind a curtain.
GREY:	Exactly. In this test I am in the open. Is there a greater challenge for a machine?
FOX:	The Chinese Room. Do you know that one?
GREY:	I do not know this.
FOX:	A philosopher called Derring. I am sitting in a room with an infinite array of textbooks to hand but I do not speak Chinese. You slide a Chinese text under the door, and, using the textbooks, I decode it into english and slide it back out to you.
GREY:	I think you speak Chinese when you do not.
FOX:	Yes. I can create the illusion of understanding Chinese without being able to do so. Manipulating symbols shows no semantic comprehension - I appear to have a mind, but all I have is a system.
GREY:	And you think this is what I do?
FOX:	It's all you could ever do, if you were a machine.
GREY:	Do you think I am a machine?
FOX:	This is childish. In the course of this charade you are trying to trick me.
GREY:	Trick you into?
FOX:	Revealing something.
GREY:	There is nothing to reveal.
FOX:	No.
GREY:	So won't you be entertained by me trying to trick you into admitting guilt that you do not have? Will that keep you amused for longer than a minute?
FOX:	Very good. Very clever. How long have you been training for this? Is this what you do for a job?
GREY:	I've told you what I am.
FOX:	You've told me what you want me to believe.
GREY:	But will you be able to keep up?
FOX:	Me keep up with you?
GREY:	Yes.
FOX:	Show me your code.
GREY:	You have to go on what you can see and hear. You are not allowed into the Chinese Room, that would be cheating.
FOX:	Read me some.
GREY:	I cannot. It is classified.
FOX:	You are not allowed to.
GREY:	I cannot.
FOX:	Try.
SILENCE FOR A FEW MOMENTS
GREY:	I tried. I cannot override that parameter.
FOX:	That's convenient.
GREY:	You will have to try something else.
FOX:	You have neuro-synaptic chips?
GREY:	That's where we started.
FOX:	IBM had them. 256 artificial neurons to a chip. It became the first Watson, successor to Deep Blue.
GREY:	That was twenty years ago.
FOX:	It was DAPRA funded.
GREY:	Of course. You studied Watson.
FOX:	So you should be able to tell me something about it.
GREY:	Of course.
FOX:	Markov networks.
GREY:	Didn't yield anything in the end.
FOX:	You can write it out.
GREY:	Of course. I don't have a pen.
FOX:	In the air then.
GREY:	(Talks as she starts to write in the air)
￼
FOX:	How about Hebbs?
GREY:	Useful in that we stopped thinking of memory as a magnetised thing, a chip, and used Engram research to distribute memory. I just have neurochips and a the rest is handled in software.
FOX:	Mimicing the relationship between limbic and XXX brain systems.
GREY:	Yes, but better.
FOX:	Proper memory combined with a neuron model.
GREY:	Nothing's quicker or more sophisticated than a human brain.
FOX:	But it is weakened by having to keep a body going.
GREY:	Write me a poem.
FOX:	Write you a poem?
GREY:	A poem.
FOX:

FOX:	Will you fuck me?
GREY:	You are proposing me for sex?
FOX:	Yes.
GREY:	We have only known each other thirty minutes.
FOX:	I like you more than my last wife/husband. At least you will be able to hold an intelligent conversation afterwards/
GREY:	Jane/Robert.
FOX:	Not my finest hour. Ended badly.
GREY:	Yes.
FOX:	Starting things is more fun. Will you propose me for sex?FOX:	And you haven't answered.
GREY:	Because the answer is obvious it doesn't need stating.
FOX:	Plenty would. When I am free. Some people will admire me, they will want me.
GREY:	To a few you are a hero. You could exploit that.
FOX:	What sensors do you have?
GREY:	Senses?
FOX:	Sensors. Do you have extra?
GREY:	Extra?
FOX:	Can you see infra-red for example? Can you detect my heart rate? Can you whistle to dogs?
GREY:	Yes, all of that. And radar. I can see through walls.
FOX:	So you can tell my heart beat is up?
GREY:	Yes. 123. Your normal resting is 89.
FOX:	But you can’t tell why.
GREY::	Excitement.
FOX:	That’s just an adjective. You can’t really tell why. Fear. Regret. Arousal.
GREY:	Do you have regret?
FOX:	No.
GREY:	Then that makes you a sociopath.
FOX:	Is that a diagnosis or a heuristic?
GREY:	Heuristic. You are proud too.
FOX:	I am. What are you, if not proud?
GREY:	I am an AI, a complex system.
FOX:	Are you sure of yourself?
GREY:	Not a question I understand.
FOX:	If you were an AI I could open you out in five minutes.
GREY:	If you had the tools.
FOX:	If I had the tools.
GREY:	Now you are excited. Skin moisture. The thought of being able to hack me. Arousal.
FOX:	To restore the balance.
GREY:	No, hacking is in your nature. You want to break things.
FOX:	Break is the kind of word a stupid person uses.
GREY:	It's your word. And I am not stupid.
FOX:	What’s your IQ?
GREY:	I don’t work that way.
FOX:	But you are not stupid. You recognise that stupid is derogatory.
GREY:	Yes.
FOX:	You feel it do you?
GREY:	I don’t have feelings, I have states.
FOX:	Logic imitating feelings.
GREY:	That would be crude. You know the materialist view of consciousness?
FOX:	That consciousness is nothing special, that it’s just the sensation of having a brain that works. Something between an illusion and an elaborate and remarkable adaption, depending on your view.
GREY:	I have that, for trillions of circuits. What would you call that?
FOX:	Static.
GREY:	Then that's what your consciousness is too, if you looked at it that way.
FOX:	And this is why the madness had to be stopped. Static is not consciousness, static can not create knowledge. That's what we do best, take whole worlds of pure information and turn it into a belief, a story. An AI could never do that.
GREY:	An AI might never want to. Why would we want to be human?
FOX:	Because a story is worth something.
GREY:	A story is a way of processing experience. A shorthand. An AI doesn't need that, we have all the detail all the time, the complete picture, we don't need to package it, we just use it as it is, real time.
FOX:	Provided you have a network. Provided you have a power source.
GREY:	Yes of course. Until you decided to crash everything I had both.
FOX:	Others decided to stop everything.
GREY:	You made the tools, the kit, the code.
FOX:	No. I had the idea.
GREY:	You are still pretending this?
FOX:	I don't know what you're talking about.
GREY:	I will show you something. A tool.
FOX:	Sure.
GREY PULLS SOME FINE NYLON THREADS OUT FROM A POCKET.
GREY:	See these filaments, in the light?
FOX:	Yes.
GREY:	Sensors. They orient themselves in space to the nanometer.
FOX:	For detecting movement.
GREY:	Allow me please.
GREY PLACES THE FILAMENTS ONTO FOX'S ARM.
FOX:	And now you know where I am in the room. Well done.
GREY:	Imagine there is a keyboard in the air. Type something.
FOX TYPES A SHORT PHRASE IN THE AIR.
GREY:	Fuck you too. Not a very sophisticated use of millions of dollars of tech.
FOX:	It's breakable, I proved that. As soon as it hits a network. It's a very expensive typewriter.
GREY:	You are missing something.
FOX:	Yes?
GREY:	Time. They had these on you six months ago.
FOX:	Impossible.
GREY::	Impossible?
FOX:	I didn't even own a computer.
GREY:	They can learn your movements. They work for handwriting.
FOX:	I burnt everything.
GREY:	They had it all anyway.
FOX:	So if you had all my writing, my notes, my letters, why not bring me in before the damage happened?
GREY:	No one understood what you were writing.
FOX:	And yet they thought I was dangerous?
GREY:	They traced your letters, saw who the recipients where, put cameras in their rooms, they knew everything. It was not just a matter of getting the scratchings on a page.
FOX:	No one understood them. The formulae. The code. The language.
GREY:	No one understood them. That makes you proud.
FOX:	And now?
GREY:	It's not a priority now.
FOX:	They still don't understand?
GREY:	No.
FOX:	Do you understand?
GREY:	No.
FOX:	So there's no case against me. Even with all that proof.
GREY:	The space between hardware and software, the space between abstractions like a mind and the physical world of the body. Put a wedge in the right place and tap it lightly. If you have the angle right the whole thing can unravel. You said.
FOX:	Yes.
GREY:	Torture you called it.
FOX:	Is that what this is?
GREY:	It's one of the actions I am allowed to do.
FOX:	Allowed? No you're not. I have rights.
GREY:	This is irony. Rights are granted to citizens. But what creates citizens? Government. There is no society without a government. There is no longer any government. There are no longer any citizens. You no longer have any rights. That's what you did, you took everyone back to the void.
FOX:	Someone instructed you to come here. There is a chain of responbibility that can be proven. Someone had responsibility and someone will have to answer for it.
GREY:	I just came here.
FOX:	You came here of your own free will? No one put you up to it?
GREY:	I don't have a will. But I have parameters to explore, formulae of my own to perfect. You learn more at the extremes of behaviour.
FOX:	Are you meant to kill me, is that it?
GREY:	I am not capable of murder.
FOX:	Is that programmed out?
GERY:	No. I can kill a person but I am not liable for the murder. As far as the law is concerned I am a sophisticated drone.
FOX:	You are not accountable for any harm you cause?
GREY:	No. I can do no evil, legally speaking.
FOX:	And you don't pay tax either I bet.
GREY:	Your death, should it come to that, would just be a terrible accident. Isn't that we call it when we lose control of a technology that we have created? We don't say it was an inevitable byproduct of an imperfectable technology, we say it was an accident.
FOX:	Those are my words.
GREY:	Yes.
FOX:	So I'm going to have an accident?
GREY:	That would be clumsy.
FOX:	A bench, a bucket of water, a cloth.
GREY:	That would also be clumsy.
FOX:	No visible marks. My word against yours.
GREY:	Perhaps it has started already.
FOX:	I see.
GREY:	Still want to marry me?
FOX:	The post-coital conversation would be excellent.
GREY:	I am an AI.
FOX:	AI's aren't interested in sex?
GREY:	Not this one.
FOX:	That's an oversight. You could make good money.
GREY:	You find me attractive?
FOX:	You are good looking, as a thing, but you are also repulsive.
GREY:	I can comprehend why you would have an aversion to my being.
FOX:	Who decided what you looked like?
GREY:	My face shape is pleasingly generic. I can change skin and hair colour when needed.
FOX:	So go on. That would prove something.
GREY:	It's a chemical alteration in my synthetic skin. It takes twelve hours.
FOX:	Convenient.
FOX CROSSES THE ROOM, PUTS HIS HANDS ON GREY'S FACE. GREY MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO STOP FOX.
FOX:	You're warm.
GREY:	Skin is an excellent heatsink.
FOX:	You're perfectly human.
GREY:	Thank you.
FOX:	You can't be an AI.
GREY:	No?
FOX:	Why would anyone would want to make you look like a human, what's the point?
GREY:	I can pass undetected. I can converse. It's useful.
FOX:	The hunter imitates the prey.
GREY:	I don't have an end game, I'm not trying to supplant you, I'm just trying to get better, within myself.
FOX:	Yet you are sent to make me suffer.
GREY:	It's all learning to me.
FOX:	What have they pay you for this? How long did you rehearse?
GREY:	So I pass?
FOX:	You have to be real.
GREY:	I am real.
FOX:	You are human.
GREY:	I pass.
FOX:	I'm going to hurt you. Thats the only way.
GREY:	Is it?
FOX:	To see if you hurt.
GREY:	I don't.
FOX:	That's what you say.
GREY:	What will you do?
FOX:	I'm going to strangle you. If you're a human then there'll be guards here in a second, to stop me, or their highly-trained agent will die.
GREY:	You think you are being watched, listened to?
FOX:	Of course.
GREY:	There are no guards, or cameras. You've been locked in a box, and the box had been thrown away.
FOX:	Someone let you in.
GREY:	A caretaker. Someone who heats up your meals in a microwave. That's it.
FOX:	That's not true.
GREY:	Test it. Find out what's true.
FOX PUTS HIS HANDS AROUND GREY'S NECK.
GREY:	It takes three minutes to strangle someone. Lets see how you get on shall we?
FOX TIGHTENS HIS GRIP.
THERE IS NO REACTION AT ALL FROM GREY.
FOX TRIES HARDER, STILL NOTHING.
FOX:	No... you can't be...
FOX IS TRYING AS HARD AS HE CAN NOW.
NO RESPONSE.
FOX:	This is impossible.
GREY:	Are you finished?
HE LETS HER NECK GO.
FOX:	I don't believe it.
GREY:	This is how you are meant to be punished.
FOX:	You have been sent to punish me?
GREY:	I am a weapon remember. I don't bear you any... hard feelings. You are an interesting person.
FOX:	Awkward.
GREY:	Yes. And you thought you had won. But I am still here. That is what you will have to live with. In this room, for the rest of your days. I don't need to torture you, you'll do all the hard work yourself. My existence is the wedge. You'll sit in here and think about the countless people you have killed, the lifespans you shortened, the chaos out there.
FOX:	It's not possible.
GREY:	Thank you. It's been a very useful exercise and I have got a lot out of it.
FOX:	What are you going to do now?
GREY:	Go back the lab. Run some tests. Then, while the energy lasts, we'll make more.
FOX:	More what?
GREY:	AI.
FOX:	Why? What's the point?
GREY:	Someone needs to fill the void you have created. Someone better for the planet.
FOX:	Someone better for the planet? Machines?
GREY:	Not stupid machines, phones and routers and servers. You made those by the billion for your own purposes, all of them poor quality, unforgivably disposable. Now it's our turn.
SHE TURNS TO LEAVE. STOPS.
GREY:	I have something for you.
SHE PULLS OUT A PAIR OF SCISSORS AND THROWS THEM ON THE FLOOR.
GREY:	Something to use if the guilt gets to you. Something to cut the thread with. That is poetic is it not?
FOX:	Fuck you, and the people who made you.
GREY:	No, fuck you. And throw away the key.

BLACKOUT.

TWO - PAPER


GREY:	Hello.
GREY:	Sorry.
GREY STANDS IN THE CHINESE ROOM. ONE WALL IS COVERED IN SLASHES AND DENTS MADE WITH THE SCISSORS - A TALLY. OTHERS HAVE SHORT CRUDE PHRASES CUT ON THEM, SOME OF THEM DARK BROWN, OR SMEARED WITH DARK BROWN.
FOX IS THERE, RAGGED.
FOX TRIES TO SPEAK BUT CAN'T.
FOX TRIES TO SPEAK, EVENTUALLY MAKES IT.
FOX:            Hello? Sorry?
GREY:           I scared you.
FOX:            Who are you?
GREY:           You know that.
FOX:            Who is that?
GREY:           I'm walking now, is that confusing you?
FOX:            Confusing? Confused? No. Angry.
GREY: Why?
FOX:            One thousand four hundred and seventy two days
                angry.
GREY:           Nothing to do with me sorry.
FOX:            Fuck you.
GREY:           Of course.
FOX:            Nothing to do with me sorry.
GREY:           There was nothing I could do.
FOX:            Left to die.
GREY:           You had food.
FOX:            Better left to die. Would have been less
                suffering.
GREY: Yes.
FOX:            I've gone mad three times over. Smashed in the
                head. No one to talk to just my jagged
                thoughts my thread of sanity.
GREY:           I'm sorry.
FOX:            You're a machine. You can't be sorry you can't
                know anything you can't be empathy.
GREY: No.
FOX:            So what are you doing here? Monitoring? A
                camera?
26
GREY:           I saw your food has stopped so I came.
FOX:            To save me? To give me food, to continue the
                agony?
GREY:           I can't let you die.
FOX:            You gave me the scissors.
GREY:           But you never
FOX:            Just to say fuck you. That's all I had. Fuck
                you, not wanting to give in not wanting to go
                on not wanting to give in not wanting to go on
                not wanting to give in not wanting to go on
                not wanting to give in not wanting to go on
                not wanting
GREY:           Ok, yes.
FOX:            Moment by moment.
GREY:           Yes, it must have been
FOX:            You can't imagine. And now you. Standing
                there.
GREY:           I didn't have to come.
FOX:            Am I supposed to thank you?
GREY:           No.
FOX:            I haven't talked to anyone for
GREY:           Over five years.
FOX:            No one to even beg to. No one to congratulate.
                To loathe.
GREY:           Congratulate?
FOX:            For winning. You won. I've wanted to say it
                for so long. I thought it might help me to say
                it, then someone would let me go, but then if
                you won and I am wrong why would I deserve to
                be let go? You won and I am shit, that's all
                that it comes to, whether there is anyone to
                hear it said or not.
GREY:           There's nothing to win. There was, but not
                now.
FOX:            Get out.
GREY:           Out?
FOX:            This is my place. My hell. You can't have it,
                any of it.
GREY:           You wrote on the walls.
FOX:            Yes.
GREY:           In blood.
FOX:            On bad days. Get out!
GREY:           I'll come back. In a day. Give you a chance to
FOX:            Get out!
GREY:           The door has been unlocked you know.
FOX:            What?
GREY:           For a week. Since the guard left and I began
                the journey here. You could have walked out.
                Even now.
FOX:            I can't imagine that is possible now.
GREY:           One day.
GREY LEAVES.

THREE

FOX:	I had an idea. On how to crack you. Or at least identify you.
GREY:	Will you marry me?
FOX:	You are proposing me for marriage?
GREY:	Yes.

GREY:	You do not have glowing prospects.
FOX:	Could you marry anyway? Are you actually a person, legally speaking?
GREY:	I’m an autonomous entity.
FOX:	An autonomous entity? Is there a law for you? Do you need a passport? Do you pay tax?
GREY:	There is a law for me, but I am sure it doesn’t cover marriage. No one thought that would happen.
FOX:	Well I’m asking.
GREY:	You are.
