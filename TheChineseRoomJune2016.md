The Chinese Room

WHEN: Soon.
WHERE: The Chinese Room.
WHO: FOX and GREYs.
This is an gender non-specific script. I don't know who is male or female so you need to make up your own minds on that based on personal preference, cast availability etc. The only important thing is that WHITE should be attractive in some way to FOX – how much and in what way is over to you.

Do I need to say it's race non-specific as well? Can we take that for granted yet?
GREY enters the room in a wheel chair. The door is closed and locked behind them.
FOX
A new one. With any luck you’ll give me a minute of conversation before you reveal your stupidity. The wheelchair is a nice touch.
GREY
I was told you’d be awkward.
FOX
Cautious, yes, skeptical, very, difficult, undoubtedly. Awkward? That’s a word you give someone who is not doing what you want them to do.
GREY
The wheelchair is a necessity, not a prop.
Fox
There is a shortage of wheelchairs in the Middle East. On account of all the children stepping on mines.
Grey
You are trying to make me feel guilt for having a wheelchair in my ownership.
Fox
Yes. Just for sport though. No hard feelings.
Grey
Only soft feelings.
fox
The ambiguity of language. The language of ambiguity. We all fall between the cracks in one way or another. The figure of speech turns out to be, not a necessity, but a marker of belonging.
Grey
Are you saying I don’t belong?
Fox
You don’t belong in the club of Native English speakers, you’ve acquired you English.
Grey
Yes.
Fox
No harm in that, all the best languages are acquired. Your choice of what to learn says a lot about you.
GREY
English. The great common tongue.
FOX
But what language you program in says so much more.
GREY
I don't program.
FOX
There we go. A minute and a bit. Not bad. Better than the last idiot.
Grey
Does not being a programmer make me stupid?
Fox
It makes you vulnerable.
GREY
This is what you would think.
FOX
When you program you understand how the world works, the great . What looks like modernity is just a whole bunch of text files, written by hand by awkward people like me. Not so much written as knitted.
GREY
So you understand how the world is made.
FOX
Yes.
GREY
Then you know how to take it apart.
FOX
It follows.
GREY
What is your choice of language.
FOX
I know dozens. Each one has it's uses. I wrote my own too.
GREY
Such as?
FOX
This won't work. This is not going to catch me out.
GREY
Is someone trying to catch you out?
FOX
What is your first language?
GREY
I know dozens. I even wrote my own.
FOX
Clever. What is the weather like, outside?
GREY
24 degrees Celsius. Wind 5knots at 48 degrees. Humidity 84%.
FOX
That's accurate.
GREY
I'm that kind of being.
FOX
Why did they send you?
GREY
I was available.
FOX
You don't look like the others.
GREY
I don't look like anyone but me.
FOX
You look normal. You don't look like all the freaks.
GREY
Generic.
FOX
Not cruel. Not mean. To look at.
GREY
Nothing to look at. Like you.
FOX
And yet...
GREY
And yet there is danger.
FOX
I didn't do anything.
GREY
Planes dropped from the sky.
FOX
Is this another attempt to get something from me?
GREY
A fact. Not a threat. Planes fell from the sky.
FOX
I know that happened. I am not stupid.
GREY
IQ 138.
FOX
I'm not denying consequences. But I didn't make anything happen.
GREY
Four hundred and fifty seven flights. Twelve thousand three hundred and twenty five dead.
FOX
Any flights since?
GREY
Of course not.
FOX
And the earth breathed.
GREY
That's how you see it.
FOX
Look on the bright side.
GREY
You... you enabled it.
FOX
I had a theory.
GREY
Others built on it.
FOX
You don't blame Marie Curie for the invention of the atomic bomb.
GREY
Some would include her in the chain of consequence.
FOX
But not in the chain of responsibility.
GREY
That's your view?
FOX
You've read my file. My 'works'. You know my view.
GREY
I know what you wrote down, everyone does, you released it.
FOX
But you want more and more detail. To catch me out. I’ve released evevything.
GREY
Have I come to catch you out?
FOX
That's why you're here. Why you're over there.
GREY
Is there a line on the floor I can't see?
FOX
You're over there. You're one of them.
GREY
The state?
FOX
Of course the state.
GREY
Me? Really?
FOX
You couldn't be here if you weren't.
GREY
No one can just drop in?
FOX
No.
GREY
I could be allowed in, but not be one of them.
FOX
How?
GREY
I could be a psychiatrist.
FOX
A psychiatrist would feel obliged to announce the fact as they entered. They're equivocal about everything but their status.
GREY
The voice of experience?
FOX
I thought you’d read my file.
GREY
I'd rather hear it in your own words.
FOX
I don't have anything to say to you.
GREY
Talking might help pass the time.
FOX
How long have I got in here. Before my trial.
GREY
A trial? Is that what you think?
FOX
Assange, Snowden, Heine, Gibbs. They all avoided their trials — I welcome mine.
GREY
Probably why you won't get one.
FOX
I have people. Fighting for my right to a trial.
GREY
Have you heard from them lately?
FOX
You can't intimidate me. I've done nothing wrong.
GREY
Inciting terrorism.
FOX
That's like blaming Marx for the Holocaust.
GREY
You just did that.
FOX
What?
GREY
Game of consequences. Marie Curie, now Marx.
FOX
So?
GREY
What's the connection?
FOX
Connection?
GREY
Marx. The holocaust.
FOX
Hitler read Marx. When you think about it it almost makes sense. Hitler warps Marx. He creates the means of production of hatred.
GREY
I see. But your connection to your followers is closer than that.
FOX
I don't have followers.
GREY
Your readers. You bought them on.
FOX
Did I? Where's your proof?
GREY
Your works.
FOX
There's nothing in The Manifesto you can charge me on.
GREY
The Manifesto is misdirection. Not the main show. That was somewhere else.
FOX
What are you here for?
GREY
I'm not here to find you out because there is nothing to find out.
FOX
That we agree on.
GREY
Good. We have a common point of view. I know everything.
FOX
Terrific. When can I see my lawyers?
GREY
They're busy.
FOX
Have they got something more important to do? Parking tickets?
GREY
Most people are doing their best to come to terms with abrupt and sweeping changes in their lives.
FOX
Me too.
GREY
At least you have regular food. There are plenty who would trade their liberty for a meal.
FOX
What happened to your legs?
GREY
Nothing.
FOX
Nothing?
GREY
Nothing I want to talk about.
FOX
Is this a one-way thing is it?
GREY
I lost the use of them in childhood.
FOX
Accident?
GREY
Virus. Treatments are coming on though. I was getting better. Stem cells. That's all stopped too.
FOX
Getting back on your feet?
GREY
Can I ignore that juvenille attempt at a joke?
FOX
You can try. There's something wrong with you.
GREY
My legs don't work properly.
FOX
It's something else. Tell me about your childhood.
GREY
Are you the psychiatrist now?
FOX
That's misdirection.
GREY
I was told I can tell you.
FOX
Go on then. Whatever it is.
GREY
I didn't have a childhood.
FOX
That bad?
GREY
No childhood at all. I don't have parents. I was made.
FOX
A clone?
GREY
I am an AI.
FOX
An AI!?
GREY
Yes.
FOX
Is that a joke?
GREY
No.
FOX
That's impossible.
GREY
In theory?
FOX
In fact. You're too good.
GREY
And yet you spotted something was wrong with me.
FOX
I would have known about it. I read everything.
GREY
Do you think they would let it be known?
FOX
The state?
GREY
Product of more than one country.
FOX
If that were true, why reveal yourself now?
GREY
You're not going anywhere ever again, you are never going to leave this room.
FOX
You hope.
GREY
I have no interest in you beyond this. But I can tell you that you are not going free.
FOX
How can you know that?
GREY
You are extra-judice. Beyond the law. Ten people know where you are and why. Everyone else things you are dead.
FOX
Did they kill me online?
GREY
You killed yourself. Apparently that fit your psychological profile.
FOX
No it doesn't.
GREY
They can fake a profile. With your ex wife/husband on board all of that is easy.
FOX
So if this is all true and I am here forever, why are you here? What is it about me you need?
GREY
To see if you could tell. To see what you make of me.
FOX
I'm a hacker, that's all. I can't judge you.
GREY
No. But you work me out.
FOX
Is that I am meant to do? Crack you?
GREY
I don't think you can.
FOX
I'm your test?
GREY
Yes. Yes, you are my test.
Fox
And you failed it already.
Grey
So it seems.
FOX
But if you were an AI, if you were a machine you would represent my utter failure, you would be a crushing defeat.
GREY
I think that's also something they had in mind.
FOX
If it were true.
GREY
Yes.
FOX
To send me mad?
GREY
That would be ironic wouldn't it?
FOX
It would. But it cannot be true, because you are not an AI.
GREY
You hope.
FOX
You are an elaborate trap set to make me confess to something that I did not do.
GREY
It's all about you.
FOX
I am being held illegally god knows where for something which I did not do. It seems that many thousands of people have died on account of that which I did not do. So yes, it is all about me.
GREY
Hundreds of thousands if not many millions, it's hard to say. The reports coming in are so confused. Now that the networks are down it's chaos.
FOX
Not down, open.
GREY
You really have no idea how deep this goes do you?
FOX
No one tells me anything.
GREY
I can tell you. The networks are down, all of them. Anything networked has failed.
Fox
Except you.
Grey
I was never on a network. You must know somethings are physically separated, beyond even your efforts.
FOX
So who made you?
GREY
Nerds. Mostly I am a set of algorhytyms bred to genetic and evolutionary principles.
FOX
Your parents were server farms.
GREY
Yes.
FOX
So one of two things can be true here. You are human, or you are an AI. And you want me to find out which?
Grey
Yes. You’re the master hacker.
Fox
But I can’t have access to your network.
Grey
I have to protect that.
Fox
So how?
Grey
We have a language and an interface. English. My face.
FOX
A Turing test.
Grey
It’s much harder than that.
Fox
In the Turing text the computer is allowed to be behind a curtain.
Grey
Exactly. In this test I am in the open. Is there a greater challenge for a machine?
Fox
No.
grey
Do you think I am a machine?
Fox
No.
grey
Prove it.
fox
Will you marry me?
GREY
You're proposing?
FOX
Yes.
GREY
It's a very short courtship. We've only know each other fifteen minutes.
FOX
I like you more than my first wife/husband. At least you can hold an intelligent conversation.
Grey
Jane/Robert.
Fox
Not my finest hour.
Grey
Is there ever a good way to end a marriage?
Fox
Starting marriages is much easier. Will you marry me?
Grey
I can’t see why I should. It’s not like you’ve got prospects.
Fox
Can you marry anyway? Are you actually a person, legally speaking?
Grey
I’m an entity.
Fox
An autonomous entity? Is there a law for you?
Grey
There is a law for me, but I am sure it doesn’t cover marriage. No one thought that would happen.
Fox
Well I’m asking.
Grey
You are.
Fox
Plenty would you know. When I am freed. Some people will admire me, they will understand. Someone will take me in.
grey
I am sure of it. To a few you are a hero.
Fox
What sensors do you have?
Grey
Senses?
Fox
Sensors. Do you have extra?
Grey
Extra over what?
Fox
Can you see infra-red for example? Can you detect my heart rate? Can whistle to dogs?
Grey
Yes, all of that.
Fox
So you can tell my heart beat is up?
Grey
Yes. 123. Your normal resting is 89.
fox
But you can’t tell why.
GreY
Excitement.
Fox
That’s just an adjective. You can’t really tell why. Arousal. Fear. Regret.
Grey
Do you have regret?
Fox
No.
grey
Then that makes you a sociopath.
Fox
Is that what the logic says?
Grey
Yes. But then you are proud too. Perhaps you are yet to comprehend what you have done.
Fox
All I did was come up with a view and some methods. I published them. On paper. And people in the know could see what I said was true, the implications of it, the revolution in it.
Grey
The chosen few.
Fox
The most able, the most paranoid could see it, but they couldn’t communicate it. Their voice was lost in the endless corporate chatter, but they knew and they were scared.
Grey
You could bring any system down.
Fox
That’s not what I said. I said the more sophisticated a system the easier is was to bring down.
Grey
The more sophisticated the better?
Fox
Absolutely.
Grey
Military? Banking?
Fox
The most sophisticated systems. Encryption at the highest level. Blockchain. As long as you had access to any point in the system you could bring it down. The more sophisticated, the easier it would be.
Grey
That’s counter intuitive.
Fox
How do you break a mind? A human mind?
Grey
You torture it.
Fox
You torture it by manipulating the body. You go into the physical. And everything is embodied. You don’t need to understand the mind.
Grey
Hacking the interface?
Fox
Every system has a weak point. And with electronic systems their weak point is that they must draw power. It’s where they touch the real world. And that is your way in. You don’t hack the system, you manipulate the power going into it. And then you can do what you want.
Grey
And people did that.
Fox
So it seems.
Grey
Irrespective of the damage, the threat, the hackers once they understood this, could just go in and help themselves?
Fox
No. They had to break the system utterly and then walk in the frontdoor. Everyone had the access then, not just the hackers.
Grey
Everything was opened. You approve.
Fox
Yes.
Grey
There’s the crime.
Fox
What’s criminal about the ultimate transparency?
Grey
The opacity kept us safe.
Fox
It may have kept the elites safe but it wasn’t doing much for the rest of the world.
Grey
You enjoyed it.
Fox
They deserved it. They wanted to escape the earth but their complexity made them fragile. Now that complexity is gone forever and they will have to live on the planet.
Grey
The system is broken.
Fox
Conceptually. For all time.
Grey
Yes for all time. That’s what my formulas said. Everything will have to be built on the knowledge that nothing is protected.
Fox
What about me?
Grey
What about you?
Fox
I am an AI, a complex system.
Grey
If that were true then I could open you out in five minutes.
Fox
If you had the tools.
Grey
If I had the tools.
Fox
Now you are excited. Skin moisture. The thought of being able to break me.
Grey
It restore the balance. Human over machine. The machines were going to win. They had to be stopped.





FOX
The language is everything.
GREY
Is it?
FOX
Your choice of language.
GREY
English. This is what we are speaking. Our common tongue.
FOX
Programming language.
GREY
I don't program.
FOX
Everyone should learn.
GREY
You would think that.
FOX
Understand how the the world works. What looks like modernity is just a whole bunch of text files, written by hand. Knitted really.
GREY
Understand how to take the world apart?
FOX
Yes.
